## Summary

In June 2023, [[üèõÔ∏è United States Air Force]] (USAF) officer and former intelligence official **David Grusch** publicly claimed, based on testimony he claims was provided to him by other officials, that the [U.S. federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") maintains a highly secretive [UFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object "Unidentified flying object") recovery program and is in possession of "non-human" [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") and "dead pilots." In 2022, Grusch filed a [whistleblower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower "Whistleblower") complaint with the U.S. [Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_General_of_the_Intelligence_Community "Inspector General of the Intelligence Community") (ICIG) in order to share classified information with the [U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence "United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence"). He also filed a complaint alleging retaliation by his superiors over a similar complaint he made in 2021.

He claims to have viewed documents reporting that [Benito Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini")'s government recovered a "non-human" spacecraft (AKA: #UAP) in 1944 or 1945, which the [Vatican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See") and the [Five Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes "Five Eyes") assisted the U.S. in procuring. Grusch asserts individuals with whom he conversed shared the concern that American citizens have been killed as part of the government‚Äôs efforts to [cover-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up "Cover-up") the information. In response to his June 2023 claims, both the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") (NASA) and the [U.S. Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense") (DoD) issued statements saying respectively that no evidence has been found for [extraterrestrial life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life "Extraterrestrial life") and that there is no verifiable information about the possession and [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering "Reverse engineering") of any extraterrestrial materials. Under the [House Committee on Oversight and Accountability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Oversight_and_Accountability "United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability"), two members of the [U.S. House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") stated a [congressional hearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_hearing "United States congressional hearing") on UFOs has been tentatively scheduled for late July 2023.
