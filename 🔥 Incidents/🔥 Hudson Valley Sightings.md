## Summary

State police discovered that widespread reports of a massive object—described by one observer as a "city of lights" hanging silently above their home— were caused by a group of pilots flying small aircraft in formation. The events were the subject of an Unsolved Mysteries episode and Night Siege, a posthumous collaboration between ufologists including J. Allen Hynek.
