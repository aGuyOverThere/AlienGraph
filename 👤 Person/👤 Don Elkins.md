## Basic Information
![[Don_Elkins.jpg|inlR|200]]
- **Name**: Don Elkins
- **Aliases**: 
- **Date of Birth**: 1930 (Died 1984)
- **Nationality**:  U.S.
- **Occupation**: Founder or L/L Research
## Background

- **Biography**: 

He was the founder and head of the University of Alaskaâ€™s mechanical engineering department in 1960-61, and was Professor of Physics and Engineering at the University of Louisville for twelve years from 1953-1965. In 1965 he left his position as tenured professor and became a Boeing 727 pilot for a major airline in order to devote himself more fully to UFO and paranormal research. He eventually became Captain and flew until his death in 1984. He also served with distinction in the U.S. Army as a Master Sergeant during the Korean War.

Before the organization was so named, Don began the work of L/L Research solo in 1955. Among his areas of focus, he used age-regression hypnosis to research reincarnation, talked with and visited UFO contactees all over the United States, often piloting his own small plane, investigated the many areas of paranormal study, and corresponded with and visited a wide variety of scholars, researchers, experiencers, abductees, and many others defying categorization throughout his very active career as a researcher. Don, along with his partner, Carla, published some of that UFO research in the book _Secrets Of The UFO_ in 1976.

In 1962, Don began an experiment in channeling using the protocols he had learned from a contactee group in Detroit, Michigan. That experiment blossomed into what became the principal effort of L/L Research: to collect and share information for the spiritual advancement of all humankind. His experiment, as it were, continues in an unbroken line today through our weekly meditations where we work with both silent meditation and channeling.
