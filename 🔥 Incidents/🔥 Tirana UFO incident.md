## Summary

Rezmie Lulo, a witness from Tirana, described three spherical, orange, glowing objects that appeared close at first but gradually rose higher. One object rapidly broke away towards the northwest, while the other two vanished instantly after. The Albanian Army declined to comment on the incident. Officials from the National Air Traffic Agency and Civil Aviation Authority stated that there were no flights at that time and no official reports of such objects.
