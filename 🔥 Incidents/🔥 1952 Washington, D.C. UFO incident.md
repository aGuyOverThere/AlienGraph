## Summary

A series of sightings in July 1952 accompanied radar contacts in the Washington area. These were the first sightings to be widely and seriously reported as potentially physical craft operated by intelligent life from another planet. In response, the CIA formed the Robertson Panel which advised Project Blue Book to "strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special status they have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately acquired."
