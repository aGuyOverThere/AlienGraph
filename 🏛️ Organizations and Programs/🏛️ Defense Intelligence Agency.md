## Mission

Provide intelligence on foreign militaries to prevent and decisively win wars.

An intelligence agency and combat support agency of the United States Department of Defense, specializing in defense and military intelligence.

A component of the [[üèõÔ∏è Department of Defense]] (DoD) and the Intelligence Community (IC), DIA informs national civilian and defense policymakers about the military intentions and capabilities of foreign governments and non-state actors. It also provides intelligence assistance, integration and coordination across uniformed military service intelligence components, which remain structurally separate from DIA. The agency's role encompasses the collection and analysis of military-related foreign political, economic, industrial, geographic, and medical and health intelligence. DIA produces approximately one-quarter of all intelligence content that goes into the President's Daily Brief.
