## Summary

Two Civil Aeronautics Administration tower operators observed an egg-shaped object emitting a white light beneath it come down to the Kirtland AFB runway as if landing. At seven times magnification through binoculars, they could see neither wings, tail, nor fuselage. They watched the object come to a stop several feet above the ground, hover, and then rapidly ascend. The operators then called CAA Radar Approach Control who tracked the object on radar.
