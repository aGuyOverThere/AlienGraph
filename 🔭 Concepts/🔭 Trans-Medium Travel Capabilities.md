# Trans-Medium Travel Capabilities

## Overview

Trans-Medium Travel Capabilities refer to the observed ability of certain UAP to move seamlessly between different mediums (air, water, space) without apparent degradation in performance or observable changes in vehicle configuration. This capability has been documented in multiple military encounters, most notably in the [[📜 USS Nimitz Incident]] and [[📜 Roosevelt Incidents]], challenging our current understanding of fluid dynamics and propulsion technology.
