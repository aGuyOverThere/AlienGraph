## Summary

In 1803, local fishermen reportedly found a closed vessel with small windows adrift. They said when they investigated it that "a beautiful young woman" with red and white hair and dressed in strange clothes emerged, holding a square box "that no one was allowed to touch" and that she spoke to them in a language they had never heard before.
