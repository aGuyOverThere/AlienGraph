## Summary

During Gemini 4, astronaut James McDivitt spotted a white cylinder with a protruding arm traveling in his orbit. McDivitt has said that it was impossible for him to assign scale to the object against the black background of space, saying that it could have been small enough to hold in his hands or "the size of the Empire State Building."
