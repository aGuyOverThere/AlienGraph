## Summary

Finnish pilot Jouko Kuronen overheard a radio conversation between air traffic control and fighter pilot Tarmo Tukeva. Tukeva was ordered to investigate "seven balloons" visible from Kuronen's position in the sky. Kuronen described the objects as discs that accelerated in formation against the wind at speeds not feasible for balloons.
