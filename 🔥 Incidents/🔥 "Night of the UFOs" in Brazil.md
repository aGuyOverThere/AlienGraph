## Summary

Radar and visual contacts were obtained with multiple 'bright colorful objects' in the sky across several states. Mirage 2000 and F-5 fighters were scrambled but failed to intercept, with pilots describing the objects as capable of impossible maneuvers and rapidly accelerating to as much as Mach 15 once approached.
