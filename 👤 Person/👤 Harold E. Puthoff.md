## Background

- **Biography**: 

Born in Chicago, IL. In 1967, Puthoff earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University with a thesis on the topic of the stimulated Raman effect in lasers. He then worked on tunable lasers and electron beam devices, and co-authored (with R. Pantell) Fundamentals of Quantum Electronics (Wiley, 1969), published in English, French, Russian and Chinese. Puthoff published papers on polarizable vacuum (PV) and stochastic electrodynamics. 

He took an interest in the Church of [[🏛️ Scientology]] in the late 1960s and reached what was then the top OT VII level by 1971. Puthoff wrote up his "wins" for a Scientology publication, claiming to have achieved [[📜 Remote Viewing]] abilities. In 1974, Puthoff also wrote a piece for Scientology's Celebrity magazine, stating that Scientology had given him "a feeling of absolute fearlessness". Puthoff severed all connection with Scientology in the late 1970s.

In the 1970s and '80s Puthoff directed a program at SRI International to investigate paranormal abilities, collaborating with [[👤 Russel Targ]] in a study of the purported psychic abilities of Uri Geller, Ingo Swann, Pat Price, Joseph McMoneagle and others, as part of what they called the [[🏛️ Stargate Project]]. Both Puthoff and Targ became convinced Geller and Swann had genuine psychic powers, however Geller had employed sleight of hand tricks, according to mentalist Ben Harris.
