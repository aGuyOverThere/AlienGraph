## What Happened

[[üë§ Chris Lehto]], in a [live broadcast dated February 4, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXRDex1IXu0), outlined his groundbreaking Theory of Everything. Chris claims to have unified general relativity, Newtonian physics, and quantum mechanics using light as the fundamental element. He introduces the concept of "light density" as the fourth dimension, which he believes is key to understanding the universe.

He posits that all matter is essentially captured light, akin to black holes, and that light's self-attraction, referred to as the "Big L" or "love force," is a universal force acting on light to shape the universe. Chris modifies Newton's law of gravity to include a density-dependent factor, incorporating Mach's principle to suggest that energy is relative to an object's mass in relation to the rest of the universe's mass.

## The Math - Basics

**Newtons Law of Gravity** - Newton's law of universal gravitation says that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

$$
\LARGE F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

- $F$ is the gravitational force between two masses.
- $G$ is the gravitational constant.
- $m1$‚Äã and $m2$‚Äã are the masses of the objects.
- $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.

**Mach's Principle** - Mach's principle posits that the local inertial frame (i.e., how objects move and accelerate in a given locality) is shaped by the gravitational influence of distant cosmic matter. This means that the reason an object resists acceleration (a manifestation of its inertia) is not due to its intrinsic properties alone but also due to its interaction with the mass of the entire universe.
## Chris's Concatenation

If we were to join Newtons Law of Gravity with Mach's principle, in more simplistic terms, our equation would look like this:

$$\LARGE F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \left(1 + \lambda \frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right)$$

- $Œª$ is a new constant introduced to scale the effect.
- $œÅ$ represents the mass-energy density of the universe surrounding the masses.
- $œÅ0$‚Äã is a reference density, possibly the average density of the universe.

However, Chris's equation, which he has presented over the last few days, specifically focuses on a cubic relationship of the density ratio between the local mass-energy density ($\rho_{\text{local}}^3$) and a constant reference density ($\rho_{\text{constant}}^3$). This equation suggests that the gravitational force ($F$) between two masses ($m1$‚Äã and $m2$‚Äã) separated by distance ($r$) is modified by the ratio of the cube of the local mass-energy density (${\rho_{\text{local}}}$‚Äã) to the cube of a constant reference mass-energy density (${\rho_{\text{constant}}}$).

$$\LARGE F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \left(\frac {\rho_{\text{local}}^3} {\rho_{\text{constant}}^3}\right)$$

The difference in the equations reflects the diversity of ways Mach's principle could theoretically be incorporated into Newtonian gravity. While my initial modification suggested a simple, direct scaling based on density ($\lambda \frac{\rho}{\rho_0}$), Chris's version uses a cubic relation, indicating a potentially more complex interaction between local and universal mass-energy densities. How and where he derived this is anyone's best guess. 

## Skepticism and Concern

Given the complexity and dynamic nature of Physics, such claims should be met with healthy skepticism while theory is tested and documented in order for studies to be reproduced and therefore determined to be valid/invalid.  However, upon asking if/when a white paper will be produced to aide in the scientific dissemination, the following replies were authored:

The behavior following [[üë§ Chris Lehto]]'s announcement has been met with genuine concern for his well being. Chris has admitted to these ideals being a product of drugs and AI conversations. However, while concerned members, including mental health professionals, brought up their concern in the [UAP Society](https://discord.gg/uap-society-813850576718397470) Discord channel ([conversation starts here](https://discordapp.com/channels/813850576718397470/947889760330993664/1204500784394539068)), many of those same individuals were banned.

Other actions, such as smashing a guitar to celebrate his "Thanos Snap", which has unilaterally started/created the, "Golden Age" of Humanity has pointed strongly to a potential manic episode.
