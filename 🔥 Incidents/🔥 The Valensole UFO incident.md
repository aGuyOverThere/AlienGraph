## Summary

French farmer, Maurice Massé, witnessed a spherical vehicle in his lavender field. He noticed and approached two individuals that he observed near the vehicle, but after one pointed a tube in his direction, he stood still feeling paralyzed. He described the beings as child-sized, pale, large-headed, with only holes where a mouth should be. Massé said that after they left in their vehicle, he was never again able to grow a healthy plant in the area where the craft had landed. He did not personally comment on the effect this had on him, saying, "One always says too much." His wife reported that the man was plagued with exhaustion for months, that he had confessed some type of communication to her, and that it was a "spiritual experience" for her husband.
