## Overview

- **Source**: #FOIA #gravity 
- **Topic**: Internal Mass Reduction Device and Intergalactic Travel
- **Author**: [[👤 Salvatore Pais]] [[🏛️ United States Navy]]
- **Date of Research**: 2016 - Present
- **Patent**: US10144532

## Summary

Between 2016 and 2018, the [[🏛️ United States Navy]], and more specifically [[👤 Salvatore Pais]] filed a patent for "Craft Using an Internal Mass Reduction Device".  [[US10144532.pdf]]

>A craft using an inertial mass reduction device comprises of an inner resonant cavity wall , an outer resonant cavity , and microwave emitters . The electrically charged outer resonant cavity wall and the electrically insulated inner resonant cavity wall form a resonant cavity . The microwave emitters create high frequency electromagnetic waves throughout the resonant cavity causing the resonant cavity to vibrate in an accelerated mode and create a local polarized vacuum outside the outer resonant cavity wall

>I wish to bring to your attention a just published paper - herein attached a (2015) 'The High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator', Int. J. Space Science and Engineering, Vol.3, No.4. pp. 312-317), which has great implications as to the feasibility of gravitational (and thus inertial) mass reduction by accelerated Spin and accelerated Vibration of electrically charged systems. The enablement of extreme craft speeds, and thus the feasibility of intergalactic travel using current engineering materials and methods, is made possible with this publication.

>It is my belief that the experimental investigations which this technical paper can initiate may prove fundamental to eventually generating the high electromagnetic energy flux values necessary to locally polarize the Vacuum Energy State, thereby manipulating the local Spacetime topological lattice energy density. 
>
>If we can engineer the metastructure of the local quantum vacuum state (comprised of multiple structures), then we can engineer the fabric of our reality at the most fundamental level (thus affecting a physical system's inertial and gravitational properties). This realization would greatly advance the fields of Aerospace Propulsion and Power Generation, eventually making possible our dream of Intergalactic Flight.
