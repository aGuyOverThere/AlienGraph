## Summary

Officially added to the Periodic Table of Elements in 2016, E115 is a man-made superheavy element that has 115 protons in its nucleus. Element 115 was discovered in 2003 in Dubna, Russia, at the Flerov Laboratory for Nuclear Reactions by a group of Russian scientists led by nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian. The element was eventually named moscovium because Dubna is a city in the Moscow region.


To make this element, the scientists accelerated ions of calcium-48 (48Ca) to around 10 percent of the speed of light and then bombarded americium-243 (243Am) with them.

### Synthesis

As with all super-heavy elements (104 to 118), the ability to create and test such elements has been extremely difficult and not cost effective. in 2018, we could create ~1 Mc atom per day.
