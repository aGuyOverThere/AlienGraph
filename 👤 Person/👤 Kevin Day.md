## Notable Events

### USS Nimitz Incident (2004)

- First to detect UAPs on advanced SPY-1 radar
- Tracked objects for approximately two weeks
- Supervised radar operations during entire incident
- Directed F/A-18s to intercept locations
- Witnessed objects demonstrating impossible capabilities
- Provided detailed analysis of radar data
- Coordinated with multiple ships and aircraft

## Key Statements

1. On initial detection:
   > "For two weeks prior to the Nimitz incident, we were tracking these objects. They were dropping from 80,000 feet to sea level in less than a second."

2. On radar reliability:
   > "The Princeton's radar systems were brand new, and they were working perfectly. These weren't false returns."

3. On object behavior:
   > "They were moving in ways that should be impossible, making instant 90-degree turns at hypersonic speeds."
