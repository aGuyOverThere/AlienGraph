## Summary

On April 30 around 11:50 p.m., a Las Vegas Metro police officer’s body camera video recorded as something streaked low across the sky. Several people across eastern California, Nevada and Utah reported seeing the flash, according to the [American Meteor Society](https://ams.imo.net/members/imo_view/event/2023/2408).

Allegedly, something crashed into a Las Vegas family yard, but exactly what remained unclear more than a month later. Drone video showed a circular imprint in the dirt.

Law enforcement officers also saw the flash of light corroborating the families story.

## 911 Transcript

**Caller:** There’s like an 8-foot person beside it and another one is inside us and it has big eyes and it’s looking at us — and it’s still there,” the caller told a dispatcher.

**Dispatcher:** OK, where is this on your property?

**Caller:** In my backyard. I swear to God this is not a joke, this is actually — we’re terrified.

**Dispatcher:** So, there’s two people, there’s two subjects in your backyard?

**Caller:** Correct and they’re very large. They’re like 8 foot, 9 feet, 10 foot. They look like aliens to us. Big eyes. They have big eyes. Like, I can’t explain it, and big mouth. They’re shiny eyes and they’re human. They’re 100% not human.

**Dispatcher:** OK.

## Claims and Assertions

- Being that crash landed (seen behind the forklift) was ~9-10ft tall. This does not line up with other intelligence that suggest beings being of child like size (150cm).
