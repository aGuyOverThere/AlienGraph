## Background

- **Biography**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar
> **Robert Scott Lazar** ([/l…ôÀàz…ëÀêr/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); born January 26, 1959) is an American businessman and [conspiracy theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory "Conspiracy theory") who claims he was hired in the late 1980s to [reverse-engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering "Reverse engineering") [extraterrestrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life "Extraterrestrial life") technology. This work supposedly occurred at a secret site called "S-4", a subsidiary installation allegedly located several kilometers south of the [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force") facility popularly known as [Area 51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51 "Area 51").
> 
> Lazar purports to have examined an alien craft and read US government briefing documents that described alien involvement in human affairs over the past 10,000 years. His claims brought additional public attention to Area 51 and fueled conspiracy theories surrounding its classified activities. His assertions have been analyzed and rejected by skeptics and some [ufologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufology "Ufology"), although he retains a following of supporters.
> 
> Lazar has no evidence of alien life or technology, and elements of his claimed education and employment history have been exaggerated or fabricated. Perceptions of Lazar have also been affected by criminal activity: he was convicted in 1990 for his involvement in a prostitution ring, and again in 2006 for selling illegal chemicals. Journalist [Ken Layne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Layne "Ken Layne") states, "A lot of credible people have looked at Lazar's story and rationally concluded that he made it up."


- **Education**: Mr. Lazar claims to have attended both MIT and Caltech. Both institutions state he did not and have no record of him. Lazar has also been unable to supply content, names, notes, fellow students to vouch for his attendance. Education has been a hotly debated subject surround the whole Lazar repertoire and most data points to him lying and fabricating the truth. 

- **Employment History**: 
	- Founder and CEO of [United Nuclear](https://unitednuclear.com/) - Sells scientific equipment and supplies. 
	- [Unsubstantiated/Contested] Los Alamos National Lab (Menson Physics Facility) Physicist. Inquiry into his role stated he was a technician for a contracting firm that did not work as a physicist or for Los Alamos. 
	- [Unsubstantiated/Contested] S-4, sub-facility (Area-51). Lazar said that his job was to help with the reverse engineering of one of nine flying saucers, which he alleged were extraterrestrial in origin.

## Notes

Lazar has claimed that during his joining the program at S-4, he read briefing documents describing the historical involvement of Earth for the past 10,000 years with extraterrestrial beings described as grey aliens (Similar to [[üïµÔ∏è EBOscientistA Reddit Post]]) from a planet orbiting the twin binary star system Zeta Reticuli. As of September 2019, no extrasolar planets have been found in the Zeta Reticuli system. In 1989, Lazar said the seats of the saucer he saw were approximately child-sized and that he had seen alien cadavers of a corresponding size.
