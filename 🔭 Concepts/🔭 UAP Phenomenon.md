# Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP)

## Overview

Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), previously known as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena or Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), refers to observed objects and phenomena that demonstrate characteristics and capabilities beyond current human technological understanding. The term encompasses aerial, trans-medium, and other anomalous phenomena that cannot be readily explained through conventional means.

## Basic Information
