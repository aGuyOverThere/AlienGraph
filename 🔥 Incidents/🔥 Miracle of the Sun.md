## Summary

Thousands of people gathered in Fátima based on reported Marian apparitions and observed bizarre solar activity. Catholic bishop José Alves Correia da Silva declared the miracle "worthy of belief" on 13 October 1930, and the primarily Catholic witnesses viewed the event in religious terms. Later, Jacques Vallée, Joaquim Fernandes and Fina d'Armada interpreted it as a mass UFO sighting.
