## Summary

After conquering the ancient Nubian city of Napata, Thutmose III had a stele erected at the Temple of Amun, beneath the cobra-shaped Jebel Barkal outcropping. The stele describes how "a star came down" to set fire to Thutmose's adversaries. The incident has been cited by many ufologists via the purported Tulli Papyrus, considered a likely fraud by Edward Condon. The alleged translation of the papyrus—published in issue 41 of the Fortean Society's magazine Doubt—included such Fortean phenomena as "circles of fire" and fish that "fell down from the sky".: 369–372
