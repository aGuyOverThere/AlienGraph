## Summary

At 8 PM on Halloween night (2004), residents were outside trick-or-treating on the streets of Tinley Park and other Chicago suburbs, when thousands of people watched, photographed, and filmed a formation of red lights hanging in the October sky above them. Similar formations of lights drifted over the area the following autumn.
