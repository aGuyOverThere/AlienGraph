## Background

- **Biography**: From the Reddit Post

> From the late 2000s to the mid-2010s, I worked as a molecular biologist for a national security contractor in a program to study Exo-Biospheric-Organisms (EBO). The aim of the program was to elucidate the genome and proteome basis of these organisms. Although the study of OBCs has been going on for decades in other programs, the new high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies of the late 90s unblocked stagnant research in this area. Since then, several breakthroughs have led to significant advances in our understanding of the genome and proteome of these beings. What we've learned so far has enabled us to outline some disconcerting perspectives about our place in this universe. Briefly, we've discovered that the EBO genome is a chimera of genomes from our biosphere and from an unknown one. They are artificial, ephemeral and disposable organisms created for a purpose that still partially eludes us. I'll be substantiating my statements after a brief introduction.

- **Education**: Ph.D Molecular Biology
	- *Speculation* - The U.S. Government does do their due diligence in regards to recruiting stable, patriotic (in a sense), and trustworthy people. This is their primary deterrent for hiring as it does not scale. However, for programs such as this (i.e., Sandia Programs, contracted programs, etc.) there is a commonality that **if** the persons background is not a red herring, is very likely. This individual most likely attended [BYU](https://www.byu.edu/) given how they were recruited in such a informal fashion. BYU is used by the [US Government as a source of stable, driven, and "country first" minded individuals](https://www.deseret.com/2022/11/1/23403019/fact-or-fiction-the-truth-about-fbi-cia-latter-day-saints-mormons) due to the Mormon faith and principles. BYU engineering is a significant pool for the U.S. Government to scale their classified programs and it's highly likely this individual attended this institution.
