Loeb is the Frank B. Baird Jr. Professor of Science at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University"). He had been the longest serving chair of Harvard's Department of Astronomy (2011–2020), founding director of Harvard's [Black Hole Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hole_Initiative "Black Hole Initiative") (since 2016) and director of the Institute for Theory and Computation (since 2007) within the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard-Smithsonian_Center_for_Astrophysics "Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics").
> 
> Loeb is a fellow of the [American Academy of Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences "American Academy of Arts and Sciences"), the [American Physical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Physical_Society "American Physical Society"), and the [International Academy of Astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Academy_of_Astronautics "International Academy of Astronautics"). In July 2018, he was appointed as chair of the Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA) of the [National Academies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academies "National Academies"), which is the Academies' forum for issues connected with the fields of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), including oversight of their [decadal surveys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decadal_survey "Decadal survey").
> 
> In June 2020, Loeb was sworn in as a member of the [President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Council_of_Advisors_on_Science_and_Technology "President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology") (PCAST) at the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House"). In December 2012, _[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")_ magazine selected Loeb as one of the 25 most influential people in space. In 2015, Loeb was appointed as the science theory director for the [Breakthrough Initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Initiatives "Breakthrough Initiatives") of the [Breakthrough Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Prize "Breakthrough Prize") Foundation.

> In 2018, he suggested that alien space craft may be in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), using the anomalous behavior of [ʻOumuamua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua "ʻOumuamua") as an example. In 2019, together with his student, Amir Siraj, Loeb reported discovering a meteor that potentially originated outside the Solar System.
