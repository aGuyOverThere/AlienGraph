# USS Russell UAP Footage

## Overview

The USS Russell UAP footage, also documented as the [[🎬 Green Pyramid UAP]], was captured by the crew of the USS Russell in July 2019 off the coast of San Diego. Released by [[👤 Jeremy Corbell]] in 2021, the footage shows multiple unidentified objects appearing as triangular or pyramid-shaped through night vision equipment. The Pentagon later confirmed the authenticity of this footage.
