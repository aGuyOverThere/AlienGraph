## Summary

During the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, a strange black object that resembles like a mango fruit and described to have greenish blue lights was spotted in the dark sky. Several military personels tried to shot down the object but failed and resulted in additional casualties as the fragments of the artillery (from the military) ended up striking those who were outside of their home in Sidoarjo during the incident
