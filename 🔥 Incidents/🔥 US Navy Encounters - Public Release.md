## Summary

The U.S. Department of Defense and the [[üèõÔ∏è United States Navy]] [have made public](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2165713/statement-by-the-department-of-defense-on-the-release-of-historical-navy-videos/through) both FIOA requests and leaks from airmen and sailors video and testimony of UAP activity. Some of which was ad-hoc in which pilots saw and tracked UAP objects while another incident where 2-3 UAP objects analyzed a U.S. Carrier Group for ~2 hours. 

- **2004** - Fighter pilot Commander David Fravor of the [USS _Nimitz_ Carrier Strike Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nimitz#Nimitz_Carrier_Strike_Group "USS Nimitz") claims to have investigated radar indications of a possible target off the coast of [southern California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California "Southern California"). Fravor said the operator had told him that the [USS _Princeton_ (CG-59)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Princeton_(CG-59) "USS Princeton (CG-59)"), part of the strike group, had been tracking unusual aircraft for two weeks prior to the incident. The aircraft would appear at 80,000 feet (24,000¬†m) before descending rapidly toward the sea, and stopping at 20,000 feet (6,100¬†m) and hovering. Fravor reported that he saw an object, white and oval, hovering above an ocean disturbance
- **2015** - During 2014‚Äì2015, fighter pilots associated with the [USS¬†_Theodore Roosevelt_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Theodore_Roosevelt_(CVN-71) "USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71)") [carrier strike group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_strike_group "Carrier strike group") were operating off the [East Coast of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States "East Coast of the United States") when they recorded the GIMBAL and GOFAST videos while reporting instrument detections of unknown aerial objects which the pilots were unable to identify.
- **2019** - In April 2021, Pentagon spokesperson Sue Gough confirmed that publicly-available video footage of what appeared to be an unidentified triangular object in the sky had been taken by Navy personnel aboard [USS _Russell_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Russell_(DDG-59) "USS Russell (DDG-59)") in 2019. Science writer and expert UFO investigator [Mick West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_West "Mick West") suggested the image was the result of an optical effect called a [bokeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh "Bokeh"), which can make out of focus light sources appear triangular or pyramidal due to the shape of the aperture of some camera lenses. The Pentagon also confirmed photographs of objects described as "sphere", "acorn" and "metallic blimp."
