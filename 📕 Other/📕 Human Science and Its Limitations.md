## Not My Science!

You all ate me alive with my [An Appeal to Non-Human Intelligence](https://aliengraph.wiki/%F0%9F%93%95+Other/%F0%9F%93%95+An+Appeal+to+Non-Human+Intelligence) post. And yeah, maybe you're right - it's stupid but I did it anyway largely in response to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/17fjbmr/alien_message_to_mankind_do_you_wish_that_we_show/). But the comments made me think about what we are defining as Science and Measurable. Was this a data-driven post with quantitative metrics that can be verified and repeated? No, it's an emotionally driven one. So, let's talk about that for a bit. 

The very idea of science is to answer questions using methods that allow others to attempt to answer the same question in a verifiable and measurable way. Yet, the stagnation of all fields of study arises from the fear of looking stupid, asking questions that at first glance have no bearing in the scientific community, and making decisions out of self-preservation. We need to learn from those who made strides by thinking differently, using feeling, emotion, art, and philosophy to draw inspiration from. We do not know what we do not know so who are you to tell me the truth of things? I'm certainly not here to tell you the truth of things but I'm willing to look stupid (and do as the internet will undoubtedly comment below).

### Alexander Grothendieck 

Alexander Grothendieck (1928-2014) was a mathematician of immense influence and significance, particularly in the fields of algebraic geometry and number theory. His work reshaped the foundations and methodologies of these areas, and his insights have had lasting impacts on several other domains of mathematics. He declined the Fields Medal in 1966, one of the highest honors a mathematician can receive.

>"In our acquisition of knowledge of the Universe (whether mathematical or otherwise) that which renovates the quest is nothing more nor less than complete innocence. It is in this state of complete innocence that we receive everything from the moment as if we were seeing it all for the first time. Without any reference to the past, without any comparison or judgment, every instant of cognition is an act of creation." - Alexander Grothendieck

In his later writings, especially in "Récoltes et Semailles," Grothendieck critiqued what he perceived as the ego-driven nature of the academic and scientific establishment. He felt that genuine scientific discovery was often hampered by issues of ego, competition, and the race for recognition. He believed in the intrinsic value of scientific exploration and felt that true breakthroughs come from genuine curiosity and a deep internal drive.

**Accomplishments**:

- **Theory of Schemes**: Generalized the concept of algebraic varieties, revolutionizing algebraic geometry.
- **Cohomology Theories**: Introduced several cohomology theories, including étale cohomology and crystalline cohomology.
- **Grothendieck Topologies**: Developed a new framework for understanding geometric and topological properties.
- **Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem**: A foundational result about the relationship between geometry and algebra.
- **Grothendieck Categories**: Introduced the concept of abelian categories, which reshaped homological algebra.
- **K-theory**: Laid foundational ideas for the development of K-theory, a tool for studying geometric and topological objects using algebra.
- **Foundations of Derived Categories**: Contributed foundational ideas which later led to the development of derived categories in algebraic geometry.

### Karl Schwarzschild

Within a few weeks of Albert Einstein publishing his Theory of Relativity and the subsequent [Einstein Field Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations),  Dr. [Karl Schwarzschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schwarzschild), while in the trenches of the first world war leading on the front lines for the Germans, wrote the first exact proofs validating Einstein's theory. Not only did he write the first exact proofs, but his equation drove him to depression and arguably some insanity because he found, within it, the existence of what was originally called the **Schwarzschild singularity** which we now know as a Black Hole. In his letter to Einstein, he wrote:

> "Only a vision of the whole, like that of a saint, a madman, or a mystic, will permit us to decipher the true organizing principles of the universe.” - Karl Schwarzschild

Later in a letter to his wife, which was written the same day he wrote to Einstein,  he attempted to describe this darkness we now know as a Black Hole:

>"I don’t know how to name or define it, but it has an irrepressible force and darkens all my thoughts. It is a void without form or dimension, a shadow I can’t see, but one that I can feel with the entirety of my soul." - Karl Schwarzschild

- [Letter to Einstein](https://www.cantorsparadise.com/karl-schwarzschilds-letter-to-albert-einstein-6661734dd3e)

Schwarzchild approached science like that of a philosopher, musician, or artist. His behavior was withdrawn and amid war, having little to no self-preserving (ego and station) attitude he accomplished something Einstein thought was not possible in his lifetime.

>"He fought against the problems from which others fled. He loved discovering the relations between multiple aspects of nature, but what drove his search was joy, the pleasure an artist feels, the vertigo of the visionary capable of discerning the threads that weave the fabric of the future." - When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamin Labatut

## A Theme in Scientific Discovery

Those who put aside self-preservation, dare to ask insane yet interesting questions, and explore regardless of the consequences (**Galileo Galilei**, **Alfred Wegener**, **Ignaz Semmelweis**, etc.) have been at the forefront of scientific discovery. They are the reasons we live the way we live today.

We look back at these discoveries as truth because we are told they are true and we can replicate this truth. But in their times, they are no different than those discussing things today that are taboo, supernatural, or un-grounded. Sure much of the past work builds upon existing foundations that give credence in some form to their community and many of the taboo theories do not have the fortune of that bedrock. Even if ideas and theories do prove to be the insane ramblings of mad men and women, the path to a conclusion almost always brings to light new ideas and new facts. 

To ridicule is to stagnate progress. To be taboo is to be un-researched. Yet, our intelligence agencies, defense communities, and universities have and are researching these things.

## My Ask

Scientific grounding and being able to define and measure success is certainly critical for the way we view the scientific process today. For the most part, this is all that matters right now and that's okay. But you're in a UFO/Alien community forum discussing things so far beyond our comprehension that maybe, we should all take a step back and re-evaluate what testing, measuring, and what success looks like from this new perspective. You attempting to apply a system made by Humans to evaluate completely new ideas, which have no basis in our current science, is one hell of a problem that we can solve.
