## Summary

This paper expands on observations of UAP's named #cosmics and #phantoms originally detailed in a March 2023 study ([[ðŸŽ“ Unidentified aerial phenomena - UAPs over Kyiv Study]]) while adding a new UAP category, #blinkers. However, this paper not only produces observations and analysis but builds a new and novel approach to using consumer hardware (Smart Phone Cameras) to monitor UAP activity. 

**Observations and Results**

> [!note] Study Details
> 1. All observations were conducted during the daytime.
> 2. Results from both Kyiv and San Diego support the same conclusions.

1. Monitoring of the daytime sky led to the detection of bright and dark objects, moving at a speed from about 1M to 16M and sizes from about 20 to 100 meters. The detection of these objects, according to Ukrainian astronomers, is an experimental fact.
2. We report the discovery of a new type of UAP, which we tentatively call #blinkers. They demonstrate regular bursts of brightness with a frequency in the range up to 20 Hz and a duration of hundredths of a second.
3. The waveform of blinkers can be characterized by a duty cycle, i.e. the percentage of the ratio of pulse duration, or pulse width to the total period of the waveform. Its duty cycle ranges from about 1 to 10 per cent. This means that blinkers can be invisible ninety-nine per cent of the time.
