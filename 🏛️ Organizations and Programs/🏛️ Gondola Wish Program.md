## Mission

This project was created to use [[üìú Remote Viewing]] and #psychoenergitics  to integrate the Soviet psychoenergitics intelligence collection threat into the all-source operations (OPSEC) support scenario. 

>BY 1978, THE [[üèõÔ∏è United States Army]] ACSI CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO WARRANT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO EXPLORE INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION APPLICATIONS OF PSYCHOENERGETICS.
>
>THE ARMY ACSI CANCELLED THE GONDOLA WISH EFFORT, PLACED A COMPLETE SECURITY ENVELOPE OVER THE ARMY'S INTEREST IN PSYCHOENERGETICS AND IMPLEMENTED A NEW PROGRAM DIRECTED FOWARD INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION USING [[üìú Remote Viewing]]. - Page 15 of 56

Due to the success Gondola Wish, the program was closed down and in-turn, [[üèõÔ∏è Project Grill Flame]] was created to widen the scope of intelligence gathering outside of just Soviet based intelligence.
