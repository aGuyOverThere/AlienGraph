## Mission

The [[🏛️ Gondola Wish Program]] was closed to create Project Grill Flame in 1978. The mission of this program was:
> To use [[📜 Remote Viewing]] as a collection method - Page 15 of 56

On September 4th, 1979, the program was operationally tasked to find a missing [[🏛️ United States Navy]] aircraft that had crashed. 

>IN THIS INITIAL. SESSION, THE REMOTE VIEWER LOCATED THE MISSING AIRCRAFT WITHIN 15 MILES OF WHERE IT HAD CRASHED. - Page 19 of 56

Due to the success of ad-hoc operational tasks (tasks outside of training and research), by December 1979, the program was committed to operations. With this new mission component, an independent investigation committee was stood up to review the programs activities and results. This committee was known as the [[🏛️ Gale Committee]] and issued a report in December of 1979 detailing findings and next steps. 

In 1981, the [[🏛️ U.S. Army Technical Intelligence Field Agency]] ASCI transferred the program to [[🏛️ U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command]]. The Director of the [[🏛️ Defense Intelligence Agency]] and Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence signed a 3 year program continuance for Project Grill Flame. Where the missions and roles of each organization were separate and distinct.

- [[🏛️ Defense Intelligence Agency]]:
	- Threats
	- Countermeasures
	- Use established psychics primarily through #SRI programs
- [[🏛️ U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command]]:
	- Apply the [[📜 Remote Viewing]] program
	- Use assigned personnel
	- Contract to enhance capability

The following organizations, agencies, and departments also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with project Grill Flame (Source: Page 26 of 56):

- Secretary of the Army
- Army General Counsel
- Assistant Surgeon General for Medical R&D
- Vice Chief of Staff of the Army
- [[🏛️ National Security Agency]]
- [[🏛️ Central Intelligence Agency]]
- [[🏛️ United States Navy]]

In December 1982, the program came under threat by Congress due to a budget issue:

>THIS JOINT SERVICES EFFORT CONTINUED UNTIL DECEMBER 1982 WHEN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE CURTAILED ALL PSYCHOENERGETIC OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES BY INSCOM IN THE NATIONAL FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM (NFIP).
>
>THE COMMITTEE WAS APPARENTLY UNDER THE MISCONCEPTION THAT THE PROJECT WAS DOURLE FUNDED, HAVING NOTED THAT THERE WERE TWO LINE ITEM ENTRIES IN THE BUDGET; ONE FOR DIA AND ONE FOR INSCOM. - Page 27 of 56

Project Grill Flame was formally closed after it's three (3) year contract was complete and in accordance with Congress and their issue with the funding pool that allowed for this program, leaders moved the program for a formal Special Access Program #SAP in 1982 under the name [[🏛️ Project Center Lane]]. 

>IN KEEPING WITH CONGRESSIONAL DESIRES, INSCOM TERMINATED FORMALife Events | Joshua Faust, INVOLVEMENT WITH GRILL FLAME AT THE END OF 1982, BUT MAINTAINED ITS MOMENTUM OF EFFORT BY THE DIRECTION OF THE CG, INSCOM, UNDER & SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAM CALLED [[🏛️ Project Center Lane]], FUNDED WITH S&IA MONIES.
