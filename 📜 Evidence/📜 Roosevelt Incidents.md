# Roosevelt Incidents

## Overview

The Roosevelt Incidents refer to a series of UAP encounters by U.S. Navy pilots from the USS Theodore Roosevelt between 2014-2015 off the eastern coast of the United States. These incidents are significant because they involved multiple trained observers, radar data, and FLIR footage, occurring almost daily over several months.

## Basic Information

- **Date**: 2014-2015
- **Location**: East Coast of the United States, Atlantic Ocean
- **Witnesses**: Multiple U.S. Navy pilots and radar operators from VFA-11 "Red Rippers" and VFA-31 "Tomcatters" squadrons
- **Evidence Type**: Multiple sensor data (radar, FLIR), eyewitness testimony, official documentation
- **Classification**: Official USG Acknowledged Incident

## Detailed Description

### The Incidents

The encounters occurred during training missions and involved objects that:
- Appeared almost daily from summer 2014 to spring 2015
- Demonstrated extreme acceleration and maneuverability
- Had no visible engine exhaust
- Reached altitudes exceeding 30,000 feet
- Achieved speeds of up to Mach 1
- Remained airborne for 12+ hours, exceeding known capabilities
- Were described as either cube-shaped with spherical enclosing or spherical with cubic enclosing

### Key Events

1. **Gimbal Video**: One of the most significant pieces of evidence from these encounters, showing an object with no discernible means of propulsion performing unusual maneuvers.

2. **GoFast Video**: Shows a UAP moving at extremely high speeds close to the ocean surface.

3. **Near Mid-Air Collision**: In late 2014, a pilot reported a near miss with what appeared to be a cube inside a sphere.

## Evidence Analysis

### Physical Evidence

1. **Radar Data**:
   - Multiple radar systems tracked objects
   - Objects appeared on both airborne and ship-based radar
   - Demonstrated unusual flight characteristics

2. **FLIR Footage**:
   - [[📜 Gimbal Video]]
   - [[📜 GoFast Video]]
   - Shows objects with no visible means of propulsion
   - Thermal signatures inconsistent with known aircraft

3. **Visual Sightings**:
   - Multiple pilot testimonies
   - Consistent descriptions across different encounters
   - Corroborated by sensor data

### Documentation

- Official Navy incident reports
- Pilot testimonies
- Squadron records
- [[_documents/2019_navy_uap_guidance.pdf|2019_navy_uap_guidance]]
- [[📜 2015 Roosevelt Squadron Safety Report]]

## Witness Accounts

### Key Witnesses

- [[👤 Ryan Graves]] - F/A-18F pilot who reported multiple encounters
- [[👤 Danny Accoin]] - Navy pilot who had at least two encounters
- Other pilots from VFA-11 and VFA-31 squadrons (some names remain classified)

### Notable Quotes

> "These things would be out there all day... keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is not possible." - [[👤 Ryan Graves]]

## Official Response

### U.S. Navy

- Initially implemented new UAP reporting procedures
- Officially acknowledged the authenticity of the videos in 2019
- Included incidents in official briefings to Congress

### Pentagon

- Confirmed the videos were taken by Navy personnel
- Included incidents in [[🏛️ DoD AARO UAPTF]] preliminary assessment
- Referenced in [[🏛️ DoD AARO UAPTF]] documentation

## Impact and Significance

1. **Military Impact**:
   - Led to new UAP reporting procedures
   - Influenced pilot safety protocols
   - Contributed to establishment of [[🏛️ DoD AARO UAPTF]]

2. **Public Disclosure**:

   - Increased public awareness of military UAP encounters
   - Contributed to congressional hearings on UAP

3. **Scientific Interest**:
   - Generated academic interest in propulsion capabilities
   - Raised questions about known physics limitations
   - Sparked debate about sensor capabilities and limitations
