## Mission

The predecessor of [[🏛️ Project Grill Flame]] due to the Perry Memorandum. The program was moved to a #SAP budget and initially managed by the [[🏛️ U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command]] before being transferred to the [[🏛️ Defense Intelligence Agency]] in 1984 after a decision was made to make the unit more responsive (available) to national level tasking.

In other words, the evidence from both the results and scientific oversight panels was high enough that this became a formal intelligence gathering method and the IC opened the doors to allow more agencies/departments to access such resources. 

In February of 1985, Project Center Lane has been offically moved to the [[🏛️ Defense Intelligence Agency]] as a form [[🏛️ Department of Defense]] #SAP program. (See Page32 of 56)
