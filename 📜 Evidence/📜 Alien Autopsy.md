## Description

The **alien autopsy** is a 17-minute black-and-white film supposedly depicting a secret medical examination or autopsy of an [alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life "Extraterrestrial life") by the [United States military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military "United States military"). It was released in 1995 by [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London")-based entrepreneur [Ray Santilli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Santilli "Ray Santilli"). He presented it as an authentic [autopsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy "Autopsy") on the body of an alien recovered from the [1947 crash of a "flying disc"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_UFO_incident "Roswell UFO incident") near [Roswell, New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell,_New_Mexico "Roswell, New Mexico"). The film footage was allegedly supplied to him by a retired military cameraman who wished to remain anonymous.

In 2006, Santilli admitted the film was not authentic but rather a staged reconstruction of footage he claimed to have viewed in 1992, but which had deteriorated and become unusable by the time he made his film. He claimed that a few frames from the original were embedded in his film, but he never specified which ones. The existence of an original filmstrip of the alleged autopsy has never been independently verified.
