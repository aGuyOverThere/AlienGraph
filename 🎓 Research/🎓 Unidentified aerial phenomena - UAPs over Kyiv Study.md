## Summary

We present our recent results of our UAP study. Flights of single and groups of #cosmics and #phantoms were detected. We have identified three groups of objects (1) a group of bright spinning objects, (2) a group of bright structured objects and (3) a group of dark flying objects.

- All observation was conducted at Day Time only. 
- All objects exhibited extremely high movement speeds and detection was difficult. 

## Terms

- **Cosmics** - Luminous objects, brighter than the background of the sky. 
- **Phantoms** - Dark objects with a contrast to several percent.

**Observations and Results**

- One observed object made a circle, covering a path of 1.3 degrees in about 1 second.
- Objects have strong variations of intensity. This can be associated with the rotation of the object and a drop in intensity with a change in orientation. 
- Objects are in-fact, rotating. 
- Calculated speed of objects, detailed in Figure 12, is ~380 m/s or 850 miles per hour. 
- Speed of dark high altitude non-rotational objects (Phantoms) is 3.7km/s or 8,276.6 MPH with a size of 102 meters.
- Observations were in both Summer and Winter. Author points out there are no bugs/insects in Winter.

> It is important to know how often phantoms can be observed. Practice shows that a set of observations lasting a few hours allows us to detect one object in a 3 x 3 degree area. For an area of 90 x 90 degrees, one can expect objects a thousand times more. Statistically, a phantom can be observed in the sky every few seconds. However, the brightness of the sky is highly dependent both on the distance of the object from the sun and atmospheric conditions. The real estimate can be an order of magnitude smaller. - Page 9

## Open Questions

- Is origin author known to provide false narratives? 
- Is the origin of the intelligence suspect based on historical reasoning?
- Do we have subject matter experts who've provided insight and/or analysis?
