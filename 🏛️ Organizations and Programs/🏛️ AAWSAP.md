# Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP)

## Overview

AAWSAP was a classified Pentagon program that ran from 2007 to 2012, funded by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) with a $22 million budget. Initially designed to study advanced aerospace threats, it evolved to include investigation of UAP and other anomalous phenomena. The program was managed by the DIA and contracted to [[🏛️ BAASS]] (Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies).
