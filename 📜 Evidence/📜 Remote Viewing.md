## Description

Remote viewing (RV) is the practice of seeking impressions about a distant or unseen subject, purportedly sensing with the mind. Typically a remote viewer is expected to give information about an object, event, person or location that is hidden from physical view and separated at some distance.
Psychoenergetics is defined as the process by which an individual may psychically interact with objects, locations, or events. This field of study is often broken down into two (2) classes:

1. Mental affects on the physical world.
2. Purely mental collection of  intelligence.

> Since the 1970's, the [[üèõÔ∏è Department of Defense]] has been involved with examining the potential uses of psychoenergetics  -  **Page 3 of 56** [[CIA-RDP96-00789R002100240001-2.pdf]]

Most individuals will know of this practice by the laymen term [[üìú Remote Viewing]]. Both Psychoenergetics and #remote_viewing can, and will, be used interchangeably in both the official [[üèõÔ∏è Central Intelligence Agency]] documentation and Aliengraphs. Within the CIA sourced document (See below), Remote Viewing is the Signals Related Information (SRI) coined term that is used. SRI is simply a part of Signals Intelligence. 

> PSYCHIC IMPRESSIONS INCLUDED MUCH DETAILED ACCURATE INFORMATION, SOME OF WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY UNREPORTED, ABOUT \<REDACTED\>. THESE PSYCHIC IMPRESSIONS WERE CONFIRMED BY HUMINT AND NATIONAL TECHNICAL SOURCES. - **Page 6 of 56** [[CIA-RDP96-00789R002100240001-2.pdf]]

>DIA AND THE MILITARY SERVICES HAVE ALL, AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, BEEN INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS PSYCHOENERGETICS TESTS, MOST OF THEM BEING APPLICATION ORIENTED,
>
>IN 1972, FOR EXAMPLE, THE US ARMY SURGEON GENERAL, THROUGH THE MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION‚Äô AGENCY, NOW KNOWN AS THE ARMED FORCES MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (AFMIC), TOGETHER WITH DIA, PUBLISHED STUDIES OF SOVIET BLOC WORK IN PSYCHOENERGETICS. - **Page 8 of 56** [[CIA-RDP96-00789R002100240001-2.pdf]]

> ALSO IN 1977, THE [[üèõÔ∏è U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command]] (INSCOM) ESTABLISHED A PROJECT TEAM UNDER THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR HUMAN INTELLIGENCE AND IMPLEMENTED THE [[üèõÔ∏è Gondola Wish Program]] - **Page 12 of 56** [[CIA-RDP96-00789R002100240001-2.pdf]]

This early research was spearheaded by [[üë§ Hal Puthoff]] and [[üë§ Russel Targ]].

## Evidence Items

### Mars Exploration

- [[CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf]]

This session is between an interviewer and a remote viewer in which the topic was extra terrestrial activity on Mars. Key notes:

- Remote viewing of Mars, 1 million B.C.
- References to pyramids, hibernation and storms
- ET's are waiting in a pyramid structure during a storm.
- ET's are dying/being hurt and waiting for a group to save them. 

### Project Grill Flame, Project Center Lane, and Project Sun Streak

- Source: [[CIA-RDP96-00789R002100240001-2.pdf]]
- Original: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00789R002100240001-2.pdf

- Project Grill Flame is the R&D predecessor to Project Sun Streak which focuses on actual Operational Intelligence.
- States benefits of remote viewing: "It is passive in nature", "It is inexpensive", "There is no known defense against it"
- Contains mentions of "Pat Price" and "Ingo Swan", as two "gifted subjects", who "gained detailed information about Soviet R&D facility at Semipalitinsk".
- Mentions "Project Grill Flame" its "first mission tasked on 4 Sep 79" to "locate a missing Navy aircraft", and "Aircraft was located psychically within 15 miles of actual crash site"
