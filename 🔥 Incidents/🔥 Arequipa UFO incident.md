## Summary

Early in the morning of April 11, La Joya Air Force Base ordered fighter pilot Oscar Santa Mar√≠a Huertas to intercept an object in restricted air space. Huertas pursued the object in a Sukhoi Su-22 and fired a barrage of 30mm shells into it. According to Huertas the object did not seem damaged and rose to 19,200 meters. He described it as similar in shape to an incandescent lightbulb with a much wider circular silver base and said that it "lacked all the typical components of aircraft. It had no wings, propulsion jets, exhausts, windows, antennae, and so forth".
