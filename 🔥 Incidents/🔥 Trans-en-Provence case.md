## Summary

Retired contractor, Renato Nicolai reported the landing of a flying object near his home to local police. Renato believed it to be a military craft. Groupe d'Étude des Phénomènes Aérospatiaux Non-identifiés (GEPAN), a branch of French Space Agency created to investigate UFOs, conducted an investigation, photographed circular impressions on the ground, and took samples of the area. Skeptics have been critical of the GEPAN investigation which took place 40 days after the initial sighting.
