# USS Nimitz Incident

## Overview

The USS Nimitz Incident refers to a series of UAP encounters that occurred in November 2004 off the coast of Southern California, involving the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group. The incident is considered one of the most well-documented military UAP encounters, featuring multiple expert witnesses, radar data, and FLIR video footage.

## Basic Information

- **Date**: November 14, 2004
- **Location**: Pacific Ocean, approximately 100 miles off the coast of San Diego
- **Witnesses**: Multiple Navy personnel including pilots and radar operators
- **Evidence Type**: Radar data, FLIR video, eyewitness testimony
- **Classification**: Official USG Acknowledged Incident

## Detailed Description

### Timeline of Events

1. **Initial Detection**:
   - USS Princeton's SPY-1 radar system detected multiple anomalous aerial vehicles (AAVs)
   - Objects appeared at 80,000+ feet, then descended rapidly to sea level
   - Radar operators tracked objects for several days prior to visual contact

2. **First Encounter**:
   - [[👤 David Fravor]] and [[👤 Alex Dietrich]] dispatched to investigate
   - Observed white, smooth, pill-shaped object approximately 40 feet long
   - Object demonstrated extraordinary acceleration and maneuverability
   - Interaction with disturbed water surface/"cross-shaped" disturbance below water

3. **Second Encounter**:
   - [[👤 Chad Underwood]] captured FLIR video of object (known as the [[🎬 FLIR1 Video]])
   - Object demonstrated no visible means of propulsion
   - Exhibited extreme acceleration and maneuverability

## Evidence Analysis

### Physical Evidence

1. **Radar Data**:
   - Multiple radar systems tracked objects
   - AN/SPY-1B passive radar system
   - E-2C Hawkeye radar data
   - F/A-18 radar recordings

2. **FLIR Footage**:
   - [[🎬 FLIR1 Video]] (also known as "[[🎬 Tic Tac Video]]")
   - Shows object with no visible exhaust plumes
   - Demonstrates extraordinary maneuverability
   - Pentagon officially released in 2017

3. **Environmental Data**:
   - Clear weather conditions
   - Calm sea state
   - Multiple corroborating sensor systems

## Witness Accounts

### Key Witnesses

1. **Command Personnel**:
   - [[👤 Gary Voorhis]] - USS Princeton radar operator
   - [[👤 Kevin Day]] - USS Princeton Senior Chief Operations Specialist
   - [[👤 Jason Turner]] - USS Princeton Tactical Information Center

2. **Pilots**:
   - [[👤 David Fravor]] - Commander, VFA-41 Black Aces
   - [[👤 Alex Dietrich]] - Lieutenant Commander, VFA-41
   - [[👤 Chad Underwood]] - Lieutenant, captured FLIR footage

### Notable Quotes
