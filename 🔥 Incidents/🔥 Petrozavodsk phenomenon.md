## Summary

Residents of Petrozavodsk reported a giant glowing "jellyfish" of light (visible for over ten minutes) looming in the early morning sky. The light was seen and photographed in several Baltic Sea countries. In response to the phenomenon, the Soviet Union created a government program to study anomalous atmospheric phenomena. This program would later attribute the Petrozavodsk sightings to the secret night launch of the Kosmos 955 spy satellite. According to Soviet astrophysicist, Yuli Platov, sunlight can cause the giant plumes of gas and dust produced by rockets to glow, especially "in twilight hours, when the rocket streaks through sunlit regions and the observer is on the nighttime side of the Earth."
