## Summary

Eyewitnesses and village residents reported a UFO sighting on May 4 around 7:00 PM. An unidentified object landed, leaving three double-banded black circles in the asphalt which Halim Çepele photographed. Witnesses described a sudden darkness, mist, bent tree branches, and a cold wind. A 10-year-old boy saw a disc-shaped object with a gray color and a thin blue line on the ground for a few seconds. The incident left the boy in shock for about three months. Other residents claimed to have seen the marks on the asphalt and observed that rose petals were burned when placed on the landing site.
