## Background

- **Biography**: 

Jim moved to a piece of wilderness in Marion County, Kentucky, in 1974 to build his own log cabin in the woods, and to develop a self-sufficient lifestyle.

There he founded the Rock Creek Research and Development Laboratories in 1977 to further his teaching of the ‚ÄúBrain In Nature Course‚Äù that he learned in Colorado in 1972. After meeting [[üë§ Don Elkins]] and [[üë§ Carla L. Rueckert]] in 1979, he joined his research with them in December of 1980. The Ra contact began three weeks later, and the legal entity that we are today comes from this joining of Jim‚Äôs non-profit charity, The Rock Creek Research and Development Laboratories, with L/L Research in 1982. We use Rock Creek as our legal name, and do business as L/L Research.

Jim and Carla were married in 1987. Jim writes a daily blog called the [Camelot Journal](https://bring4th.org/members.php?uid=214) that Carla began in 2005. He is currently writing _Living the Law of One 102: The Outer Work_ in 2021 and _Living the Law of One 103: The Inner Work_ in 2022, both from Carla‚Äôs outlines. He also creates wonderful flower gardens and stonework. He enjoys beauty, nature, dance, and meditation.
