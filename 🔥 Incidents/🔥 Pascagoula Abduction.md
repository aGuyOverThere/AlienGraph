## Summary

Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker were fishing from a pier on the Pascagoula River when they say that they heard whirring sounds and witnessed a craft over 30 feet long with flashing lights. Both men say they were paralyzed and then taken by humanoids with "robotic slit-mouths" and "crab-like pincers".
