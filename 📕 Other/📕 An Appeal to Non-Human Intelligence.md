## Your Message and Our Understanding

Over the decades, be the events real or fabricated, a common message can be distilled from your contacts and conversations with Humans.

- We are killing the Earth, our Earth, the thing that made us, Us.
- Our technology is killing us and the world in which we rely.
- Our leaders know of your, and others, existence but it threatens the power balance and the subservience of Humanity.
    - There are other intelligences that are influencing and/or controlling our leaders.
- We've invested heavily in technologies that have nothing to do with understanding consciousness, psychology, and parapsychology among other fields that would no doubt change how we feel, care for, love, and empathize towards our fellow Humans and subsequently - fellow intelligences.
    - The demonization of those who self-invest in learning and practicing these fields of study is to our own detriment. Often, by design.
- We've fallen prey, not unlike many other intelligences, to rampant misinformation that divides us, Humans, weakens the collective capabilities of Humanity, and adds entropy to an already fragile path to enlightenment.
- We are important and capable of so much.
- To love and feel love for all life.

## We know, We're sorry, We're powerless

Your messages are clear, correct, and frustrating. Many of us, albeit still the vast minority of Humans, have some form of understanding in one or many of your messages. I would like to address your messages but provide insight from those of us (Humans) living in this reality and what we are trying, but failing, to do about them.

### Earth

Our current science does well at delineating our impact on the Earth and how our past technological leaps catapulted us into our current situation regarding rapid climate change. Our reliance on fossil-fuel energy is 1.) Compulsory to exist in modern society in order to live and take care of our loved ones, and 2.) not due to technical limitations on other forms of energy but rather, purely due to consolidated power structures that lobby leaders (representatives) to keep this technology alive even to the detriment of their fellow Humans.

The data, science, and advocacy for change is overwhelming yet - here we stand, powerless to the leaders and interest groups that be. Regardless of country, creed, or religion - our voices mean less and less with every moment that passes. Those who take to protesting or more "extreme" forms of advocacy are incarcerated, imprisoned, and their voices drowned. We will persist in our mission to save the very thing that gave us life - I am not confident in our success but our determination is unyielding. Again, we are the minority.

### Technology

Outside of fossil fuels, nuclear energy, and its weaponization - I'm not sure what you're referring to. Possibly, inventions such as the internet that has significantly increased communication and access to education while also being perverted by the wealthy to spread misinformation for monetary or political gain.

As for nuclear energy, the application of such a technology is far from being influenced or controlled by the majority, and our influence on policy is so minuscule, that our efforts are better focused on providing and loving the ones around us rather than worrying about something we have tried and keep failing to change.

There is a common theme here within Humanity. We can see the problem, we can measure the problem, and we can devise effective solutions to these problems. Yet, the influence of many is disregarded by the few in power. We can, and have, gone to violence but that only further divides and entropy rises. That solution does not scale.

### Humanity

I cannot speak for other Humans but for myself. I grew up with an insatiable curiosity about the world and our place in it. I felt as if I already understood we were not alone. This was innate, ingrained, and simply part of me from the start. I was indoctrinated into Christianity (Catholicism) from the day I was born. This faith feverishly attempted to drive away this curiosity and the "of the world" feeling. I understand why they did it and know why they need their faith. It's a scary world after all.

This is the story for a vast majority of Humans, as you already know. So, it should not come as a surprise that the appetite for the "supernatural" is well reserved for Religion but, in scarce supply for everything else. We've not yet come to the realization that our definition of supernatural is simply our inability to understand due to lack of research or because we simply do not have the faculties to understand. Those of us who are more attuned to this side of life are deemed outcasts, nonintellectual, and unworthy. I, am not one of these people and I cannot speak for them but, given what society has categorized them as - this system of disenfranchisement will continue. As for me, I invested in hard and classical science and technology where I work as an Engineer. If it was not for a complete mental breakdown and a slow rebuilding of my understanding of the world and my place in it, I would have never seen how I was so wrong for so many things. From our languages that dictate how we see and measure our world (Time) to the powers that dictate everything about our lives (food, transport, and my value) - we think in closed boxes with little to no room for "nonsense". We are shaped this way to be efficient, hard-working, dedicated, subservient, divisive, loyal, and above all else controllable. I say this having just worked an 8-hour day at a job where I like to think I am contributing to Humanity in some way but really, I'm helping build a product to sell. I am not above anyone, but I see the error in my ways and the harm I have caused. And I know what I am doing right now to change. Yet, a path forward is unclear. I don't think I'm alone in this sentiment.

## Our Appeal

You come to us speaking truths that we cannot change, facts we are outcast for in our attempts to reverse, and innate sentiments of love and empathy that were driven from us in youth as weakness. Your messages do not land on deaf ears, they land on ears that have been disenfranchised or ears of powers that do not care. Maybe I, we're, too late in asking this or maybe this is an ignorant attempt of appeal but, we want you here. We want your help. We want/need to change. We do not know what we do not know - help us understand and evolve.
