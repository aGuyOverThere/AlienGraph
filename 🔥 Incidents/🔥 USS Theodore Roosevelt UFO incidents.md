## Summary

Navy pilots from the Theodore Roosevelt began to notice unexplained objects on their radar after an equipment upgrade. Some pilots were unable to see the objects. Others captured video footage, later released to the public. The pilots reported these incidents to the then-obscure Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program resulting in new guidelines regarding unexplained aerial phenomena sightings.
