## Background

- **Biography**: 

Carla was a meditator with the group [[ðŸ‘¤ Don Elkins]] started in early 1962, and became partners with [[ðŸ‘¤ Don Elkins]] in 1968. In 1970, she turned full-time to assisting Don with his research and together they formed L/L Research. 1974, she began channeling and continued unceasingly in that effort until she was stopped in 2011 by a spinal fusion surgery.

In addition to channeling, she read and abstracted books and periodicals, and did correspondence and writing for Don. As a result of their work together in investigating UFO contacts and abductions they published _Secrets of the UFO_ in 1977. However, the first book that they wrote as soon as they got together in 1968 was _The Crucifixion of Esmerelda Sweeetwater_, which was not published until 1986. She wrote _A Channeling Handbook_ in 1987, _A Wandererâ€™s Handbook_ in 2001, channeled _A Book of Days: Channelings From the Holy Spirit_ in 2007, _Living the Law of One 101: The Choice_ in 2009, co-channeled _The Aaron/Qâ€™uo Dialogues_ with Barbara Brodsky in 2011, and had her book of poetry, _The Poetry of Carla Lisbeth Rueckert_, published in 2012.
