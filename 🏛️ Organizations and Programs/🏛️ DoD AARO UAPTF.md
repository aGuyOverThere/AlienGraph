## Mission

The **All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office** (**AARO**) is an office within the United States [Office of the Secretary of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Secretary_of_Defense "Office of the Secretary of Defense") that investigates [unidentified flying objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object "Unidentified flying object") (UFOs) and other phenomena in the air, sea, and/or space and/or on land: sometimes referred to as "unidentified aerial phenomena" or "unidentified anomalous phenomena" (UAP).

AARO was preceded by **The Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF**), a 2017 to 2020 program within the [Office of Naval Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Intelligence "Office of Naval Intelligence") used to "standardize collection and reporting" of sightings of UFOs. UAPTF was detailed in a June 2020 hearing of the [United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence "United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence"). The UAPTF [issued a preliminary report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_Report_(U.S._Intelligence) "UFO Report (U.S. Intelligence)") in June 2021. In July 2022, it was announced that the UAPTF would be succeeded as an organization by AARO. [NASA's UAP independent study team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA%27s_UAP_independent_study_team "NASA's UAP independent study team") held a public meeting in June 2023 showing further UAP footage released by AARO.
