## Summary

The **interdimensional hypothesis** is a proposal that [unidentified flying object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object "Unidentified flying object") (UFO) sightings are the result of experiencing other "dimensions" that coexist separately alongside our own in contrast with either the [extraterrestrial hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_hypothesis "Extraterrestrial hypothesis") that suggests UFO sightings are caused by visitations from outside the Earth or the [psychosocial hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial_hypothesis "Psychosocial hypothesis") that argues UFO sightings are best explained as psychological or social phenomenon.

The hypothesis has been advanced by [ufologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufology "Ufology") such as [Meade Layne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meade_Layne "Meade Layne")[John Keel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keel "John Keel"), [J. Allen Hynek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Allen_Hynek "J. Allen Hynek"), and [[ðŸ‘¤ Jacques Vallee]]. Proponents of the interdimensional hypothesis argue that UFOs are a modern manifestation of a phenomenon that has occurred throughout recorded [human history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history "Human history"), which in prior ages were ascribed to [mythological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythological "Mythological") or [supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural "Supernatural") creatures.

[Jeffrey J. Kripal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_J._Kripal "Jeffrey J. Kripal"), Chair in Philosophy and Religious Thought at Rice University, writes: "this interdimensional reading, long a staple of Spiritualism through the famous 'fourth dimension', would have a very long life within ufology and is still very much with us today".
