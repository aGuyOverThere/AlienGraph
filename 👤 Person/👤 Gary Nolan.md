## Notes

In 2012, Nolan began analysis on the [Atacama skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_skeleton "Atacama skeleton"), a suspected alien corpse from [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile"), which he later revealed to be a [mummified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummified "Mummified") human [stillbirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillbirth "Stillbirth") with genetic bone defects and gene mutation causing deformity

He was later approached by US intelligence officials and an aerospace corporation to "help them understand the medical harm that had come to some individuals, related to supposed interactions with an [anomalous craft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO "UFO")." He was chosen primarily for the types of [blood analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_analysis "Blood analysis") his lab can perform. Initially via [CyTOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyTOF "CyTOF") blood analysis, he helped investigate the brains of around 100 patients, mostly "defense or governmental personnel or people working in the aerospace industry", of which a subset claimed to have seen [unexplained aerial phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO "UFO") (UAP). The majority exhibited symptoms that were "basically identical to what's now called [Havana syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana_syndrome "Havana syndrome")" and had their [brains scanned via MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI_brain_scan "MRI brain scan"). Nolan stated that some of the brains were horribly damaged and that while much of the damage was random, "what we thought was the damage across multiple individuals" turned out to be a "over-connection of neurons between the head of the [caudate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudate_nucleus "Caudate nucleus") and the [putamen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putamen "Putamen")" which he claims was disproportionate in this cohort compared to the general population (with the general population only showing about 1 in 100 individuals with the feature). Others have independently verified the role of the caudate in intelligence and planning. This brain characteristic was something subjects were born with for multiple individuals in this subset.

Nolan is the lead author of the first study published in a peer-reviewed journal about [anomalous materials associated with UFOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufology#Phenomena_linked_to_ufology "Ufology"). The article reviews modern [analytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_materials_analysis_methods "List of materials analysis methods") procedures, including [mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry "Mass spectrometry"), for characterization, analysis, and identification of unknown materials and how such have been applied thus far to study materials that, according to witnesses, dropped from hovering UFOs such as materials of the [1977 Council Bluffs incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1977_Council_Bluffs_incident&action=edit&redlink=1 "1977 Council Bluffs incident (page does not exist)"). Since the formation of the [Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_Aerial_Phenomena_Task_Force "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force") in 2020, multiple publications have reported on Nolan's involvement with [The Pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon "The Pentagon") and the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA "CIA") investigating samples of materials supposedly ejected at purported sites of UFO sightings.

Nolan appeared on Fox News' _[Tucker Carlson Tonight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson_Tonight "Tucker Carlson Tonight") show on August 1st 2022, during which he discussed his UAP related research in an hour long interview.

Nolan said that he gives the probability as "100 percent" that extraterrestrials have not only visited Earth but have been visiting earth for a long time. He also shared his speculation that what has visited earth are simply "emissaries" and possibly drones, but that they are regular occurrences and that some governments have retrieved artifacts from these extraterrestrial craft. This was shared during a SALT iConnections conference in Manhattan in May of 2023 during an interview with Alex Klokus titled "The Pentagon, Extraterrestrial Intelligence and Crashed UFOs". As _[New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times "New York Times")_ columnist [Ezra Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Klein "Ezra Klein") interviewed journalist and UFO author [Leslie Kean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Kean "Leslie Kean") in June 2023, Kean told Klein that Nolan "knows [[ðŸ‘¤ David Grusch]] very well and vouches for him".
