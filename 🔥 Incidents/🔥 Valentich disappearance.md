## Summary

Frederick Valentich left Moorabbin Airport in a Cessna 182 Skylane, a single-engined light aircraft. At 7:06 PM, he began reporting a strange craft to Melbourne air traffic control. Valentich's last words were, "That strange aircraft is hovering on top of me again … it is hovering and it's not an aircraft." Neither the pilot nor the plane were ever found.
