## Summary

Just months after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, U.S. radar stations picked up an unidentified aerial object in the early morning. For several hours, anti-aircraft artillery fired thousands of rounds into the searchlight-scoured sky. The LA Times reported that “the air over Los Angeles erupted like a volcano.”
