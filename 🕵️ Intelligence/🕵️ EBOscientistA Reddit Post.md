## Summary

Alleged molecular biologist for a national security contractor worked on a program to analyze the deceased remains of EBO's. Author seems to be very technically apt with a Ph.D level understanding of not only field standard operating procedure but of the subject matter as well. 

Ad-hoc efforts to understand the credibility and technical validity of the claims are being made in several informal forums:

- [r/molecularbiology debunking](https://www.reddit.com/r/molecularbiology/comments/14sbapm/can_any_of_you_debunk_this_possible_offplanet/)
- [r/aliens skepticism](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/14sdom8/ebo_scientist_skepticism_thread/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
