## Description

In early August, the United States Customs and Border Patrol released 10 videos depicting reported UAPs along with [387 pages of supporting documents](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2023-Aug/Records%20pertaining%20to%20Unidentified%20Aerial%20Phenomenon.pdf) ([[Records pertaining to Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon.pdf]]) including testimony from eyewitnesses written by [[üë§ Franc Milburn]].

The videos, some of which leaked a few years back, have added fuel to the already raging fire of public discourse around #UAP. One video in particular, from 2013, shows an unidentifiable spot flying over an airport. The video is black and white, and the footage is grainy. The object, whatever it is, cruises over the airport at what appears to be a consistent rate, on a path taking it toward the ocean.
