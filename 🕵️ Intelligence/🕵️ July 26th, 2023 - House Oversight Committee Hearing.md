Three retired military veterans testified Wednesday at a House hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena – commonly known as UFOs – warning that the sightings are a national security problem and that the government has been too secretive about them.

## Claims and Assertions

> “If UAP are foreign drones, it is an urgent national security problem. If it is something else, it is an issue for science. In either case, unidentified objects are a concern for flight safety,” - [[👤 Ryan Graves]]
> “The technology that we faced was far superior than anything that we had” - [[👤 David Fravor]]
> "Navy pilots reported to their superiors that the objects had no visible engine or infrared exhaust plumes, but that they could reach 30,000 feet and hypersonic speeds," - [[👤 Ryan Graves]]

During questioning about if Humans have been injured/killed by UAP and Non-Human Intelligence (#NHI):

> I know of multiple colleagues that have been physically injured by both UAP's and our Government. - [[👤 David Grusch]]
